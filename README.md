# 🧠 Mapping the Pain: My Migraine Journey Through Data

This project explores a 10-month self-tracked migraine dataset to identify patterns and potential triggers affecting migraine frequency, duration, and intensity.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset includes daily records such as:
- Hydration level
- Sleep quality
- Noise exposure
- Activity level
- Pain severity
- Medication usage

The goal is to discover which factors are most strongly associated with migraine days and help improve lifestyle decisions for better migraine management.

## 📈 Key Insights (summary)
- Higher hydration appears correlated with fewer migraine days.
- Increased exposure to loud noise is commonly seen on migraine days.
- Physical activity tends to reduce pain intensity.

Detailed visualizations and full analysis can be found in the Word project document included in this repository.
